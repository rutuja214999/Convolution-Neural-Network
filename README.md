## Problem Statement:
### Build a CNN model on CIFAR-10 dataset by applying few regularization techniques like drop out and data augmentation

The CIFAR10 dataset contains 60,000 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images in each class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. The classes are mutually exclusive and there is no overlap between them.
